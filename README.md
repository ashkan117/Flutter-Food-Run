# flutter_gmr_run

An easier way to organize food runs! Rushed on time for lunch? Communicate between each other so that multiple people don't waste time going to the same place to get food.

[GMR](https://greatmindsrobotics.com/index.php) was a robotics learning center where I used to work. On busy days we didn't have too much time to run to walk to a resturant, order food, walk back, eat and relax. This made it even more painful knowing that most of us would end up going to the same place anyways. I wanted to build a cross platform mobile application to allow people to opt into having other people pick it up for you. On days you wanted to walk there yourself you could volunteer yourself to order for others. If you wanted to relax a little more you can ask someone to order for you.
